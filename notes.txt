this replacement keybind system uses the "Input" flash object thats normaly used in the Binding Dialog to receive input events when this object is listening for
input events it blocks all input events from getting sent to any other active flash and from the engines own internal keybind mapping system so we have recreate 
the engines behavior for Move.commands and Move.move and feed it back in by hooking the OverrrideInput function of the local clients entity


The Red I in the top corner indicates input events are currenly being tracked it should auto deactivate when you are entering chat text and when you open the in game menu
"resetkeybinds" will reset keybinds to there defaults 
"resetinput" console command causes keybind system to recreate its self
